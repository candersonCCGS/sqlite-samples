This repository contains sample database projects, using SQLite for the RDBMS and mostly using Python CGI with HTML/CSS for the front end.

To use the sample databases:

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Clone the repository and save it to your computer
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder for the database you want to use (that is, either the FuelWatch of Mondial folder)
4. Run the script http_server.py so start a Python webserver. This should open a browser window with the home page for your database

__NOTE:__ If the webserver starts and returns a __404: File not found__ error, make sure that the http_server.py file is being executed from the correct folder.
